Our app ekaTimer is a meditation timer that requires background execution for the following user-initiated scenarios:

1. Timer Completion Notification: 
When a user starts a meditation session, the timer must continue running even when the screen is off or the user is not actively interacting with the app. The foreground service ensures the timer accurately tracks the session duration and notifies the user when their meditation session ends.

2. Doze Mode Compatibility:
Android's battery optimization (Doze mode) can delay or prevent alarms from firing. The foreground service ensures the timer reliably wakes the device and plays the completion sound at the exact scheduled time, which is critical for users who meditate with the screen off.

3. User Experience:
Without the foreground service, the timer could be killed by the system while the user is meditating, resulting in no completion notification. This would be a poor user experience for a timer app.

The service displays a persistent notification indicating "Timer is running..." which is noticeable to the user and informs them that their meditation session is active.
